# BikeOrCar
Is the weather good enough to go by bike or should I take my car?

`Bike Or Car` is still under construction. Be patient... Or contribute!

With `Bike Or Car`, you will be able to know when the weather is good enough to commute by bicycle, or when you would better use your car, or public transportation. There will be a mobile application and a website.

How does it work?
  - the program uses the Open Weather API, https://openweathermap.org/
  - it retrieves weather forecast for next 5 days
  - user can define his tolerance:
    - rain
    - snow
    - temperature
    - wind
    - and the days when he is off (week-end)

How can you currently use it? There is a beta version available here: https://bikeorcar.herokuapp.com/

Yes, it is not finished yet... but if you like the idea, come back in few weeks, or contribute to make if faster ;-)
